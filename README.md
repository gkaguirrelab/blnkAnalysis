# blnkAnalysis 

This repo contains the code necessary to analyze videos for the BLNK project. 
It is dependent on the Pylids GitHub repo, in addition to custom code that 
we have written to do this analysis. 

## Installation 

First, simply clone the repo, but ensure to also clone submodule (in this case, pylids)

```bash
$ git clone git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:zkelly1/blnkAnalysis.git
```

Then, follow the setup instructions for pylids, located in the <pylids> directory. 

## Usage 

The entire pipeline can be interacted with via the JupyterNotebook located in </blnk_analysis_pipeline>.
